* MAYBE Implement syscmd/esyscmd
  - [X] syscmd : no output is captured (stdout & stderr > /dev/null)
  - [ ] esyscmd

* MAYBE Implement traceon/traceoff
  With no arguments, trace all macros (including built-ins).  With args,
  only trace the specified macros.

* MAYBE Debug options (a la "m4 -d")
  The `-d' option to m4 controls the amount of details presented, when
  using the macros described in the preceding sections.

  The flags following the option can be one or more of the following:

  - a :: * Show the actual arguments in each macro call.  This applies
    to all macro calls if the `t' flag is used, otherwise only the
    macros covered by calls of traceon.
  - c :: Show several trace lines for each macro call.  A line is shown
    when the macro is seen, but before the arguments are collected; a
    second line when the arguments have been collected and a third line
    after the call has completed.
  - e :: * Show the expansion of each macro call, if it is not void.
    This applies to all macro calls if the `t' flag is used, otherwise
    only the macros covered by calls of traceon.
  - i :: Print a message each time the current input file is changed,
    giving file name and input line number.
  - f :: Show the name of the current input file in each trace output line.
  - l :: Show the the current input line number in each trace output line.
  - p :: Print a message when a named file is found through the path
    search mechanism, giving the actual filename used.
  - q :: * Quote actual arguments and macro expansions in the display
    with the current quotes.
  - t :: Trace all macro calls made in this invocation of m4.
  - x :: Add a unique `macro call id' to each line of the trace output.
    This is useful in connection with the `c' flag above.
  - V :: A shorthand for all of the above flags.

  If no flags are specified with the `-d' option, the default is `aeq'.

  There is a builtin macro debugmode, which allows on-the-fly control of
  the debugging output format:
        debugmode(opt flags)

  The argument flags should be a subset of the letters listed above.  As
  special cases, if the argument starts with a `+', the flags are added
  to the current debug flags, and if it starts with a `-', they are
  removed.  If no argument is present, the debugging flags are set to
  zero (as if no `-d' was given), and with an empty argument the flags
  are reset to the default.

* MAYBE Implement debugfile

* MAYBE Implement @dumpdef SYM
  Dumps just one symbol, not entire table
