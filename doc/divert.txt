DIVERT
======
@divert
    Same as @divert 0

@divert -1
    All subsequent output in this diversion is discarded.

@divert 0
    Resume normal output -- all subsequent output is sent to standard
    output (aka stream # 0)

@divert N       # N ::= 1..9
    All subsequent output is sent to stream N

@divert N1 N2...
    Error!  Multiple arguments are not allowed.

If divert argument is not an integer, no action is taken and no error is
thrown.


UNDIVERT
========
@undivert
    Inject all diversions, in numerical order, into current stream.

@undivert -1
    No effect.

@undivert 0
    No effect.

@undivert N
    Inject only the numbered diversion into current stream.

@undivert N1 N2 ...
    Inject all specified diversions (in argument order, not numerical
    order), if legal, into current stream.

If undivert argument is not an integer, no action is taken and no error
is thrown.


END-OF-DATA PROCESSING
======================
There is an implicit @divert 0/ @undivert when m2 reaches the end of
its input.  If you want to avoid this, end your last data with:

    @divert -1
    @undivert
