Q. What is the difference between @define and @newcmd?

A. @define (and @longdef) create a symbol whose value can be substituted
in-line whenever you wish, by surrounding it with "@" characters, as in:

    Hello @name@, I just got a great deal on this new @item@ !!!

You can also invoke mini "functions", little in-line functions that may
take parameters but generally produce or modify output in some way.

Names declared with @newcmd are recognized and run in the procedure that
processes the control commands (@if, @define, etc).  These things can
only be on a line of their own and (mostly) do not produce output.
